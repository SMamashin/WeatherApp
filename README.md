## ___WeatherApp___ - a local project written to improve knowledge.

### ___About the project___
This application is like https://github.com/SMamashin/WeatherApp-Qt5 allows you to get detailed weather at the moment in any existing* city or country. üå§

---
### ___Features of my project___ 
* Maximally open source
* Unique design
* Two versions on eel/js & only PyQt

The backend of this version is written in Python üêç & JavaScript ‚òïÔ∏è
Frontend is implemented in html & css/js üåà

---
### ___PIP modules that I used in this* version___
* Eel
  * Makes it possible to run html as a separate application
  * weather.py
   ```python
    eel.start("ui.html", size=(1089, 959))
   ```
   * ui.html
   ```javascript
         async function display_weather() {
            let city = document.getElementById("location").value;

            let search = await eel.get_weather(city)();
            document.getElementById("info").innerHTML = search;

            let error = await eel.get_weather(error)();
            document.getElementById("info").innerHTML = error;

            
        }

        $("#btn").on('click',function() {
            display_weather()
        });
        
* PyOWM
   * Get weather
  * Get detailed status
  * In these variables I got detailed information
      ```python
        tg = weather.temperature("celsius")
        local_temp = tg['temp']
        f_like = tg['feels_like']
        max_temp = tg['temp_max']
        min_temp = tg['temp_min']
        wind = weather.wind()['speed']
        pressure = weather.pressure['press']
        moisture = weather.humidity
        status = weather.detailed_status
---
### ___How to build?___
To run the code you will need Python on your PC and also install a couple of modules
  * pip install eel
  * pip install pyowm
    
You can also build the code in .exe using <u>Pyinstaller</u>
  * pip install pyinstaller
  * pyinstaller -F weather.py
    
Compiled .the exe will be waiting for you in the "dist" folder
